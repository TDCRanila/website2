# Portfolio Website 2.0

Here you can find the source code of my (second) static portfolio website. Feel free to use it as an inspiration.

The website is hosted on *GitLab* using its ['Pages'](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/) feature.

The project is build with ['Hugo'](https://gohugo.io/) (extended version). Which is an open-source static site generator. (I actually liked working with it more than Jekyll.)

The base theme is ['Risotto'](https://github.com/joeroe/risotto), while ['Binario'](https://github.com/Vimux/Binario) is partially used for the project cards.
