## Internship
During my internship as an **Junior AI/Gameplay Programmer**, I joined the **AI/NPC team** which was part of the gameplay department. This was on-site in Sweden, but the last couple of months were remote due to COVID policies.

I would join the The Division project when it had already launched, and thus I worked on several post-launch updates. Though for the development of WoNY, I was part of the majority of it — for both feature work and periods of bug-fixing & polishing.

My internship started in September 2019 and concluded around June 2020. This period can be split up into multiple parts:
<br>
1. Getting familiar with the tech and development environment.
2. Working on post-launch updates — bug-fixing and working on live issues & crashes.
3. Working on the WoNY expansion — notably on cooperative NPC behaviour.
4. Working on post-launch WoNY — polishing of systems, bug-fixing, and working on live issues & crashes.

## Learnings
- With having worked on The Division 2 and WoNY — it being my first AAA commercial product that I have been a part of — I have learned a whole lot from that experience. It being a live service game was interesting and also a valuable learning experience.
- I noticed that school has prepared me well for the game industry.
- That I should make sure to try and keep a better balance between making things fun for the player and perfecting of systems/features.
- To make sure to keep a healthy work-life balance as it is important for mental health.
