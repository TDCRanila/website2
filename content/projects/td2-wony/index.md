## Internship
During my internship as an **Junior AI/Gameplay Programmer**, I joined the **AI/NPC team** which was part of the gameplay department. This was on-site in Sweden (Mälmo), but the last couple of months were remote due to COVID policies.

I joined *The Division 2* project when it had already launched prior that year. And because of that, I have worked on several post-launch updates for the base game. Although, for the development of the expansion - *Warlords of New York*, I took part in the majority of its development. Doing both feature work and periods of (post-launch) bug-fixing & polishing.

My internship started in September 2019 and concluded around June 2020. This period can be split up into multiple parts:
<br>
1. Getting familiar with the tech and development environment.
2. Working on post-launch updates — bug-fixing and working on live issues & crashes.
3. Working on the WoNY expansion — notably on cooperative NPC behaviour.
4. Working on post-launch WoNY — polishing of systems, bug-fixing, and working on live issues & crashes.

- I did notice that my school had prepared me well for the game industry as integrating into the team went smooth and without issue.
- That I should make sure to try and keep a better balance between making things fun for the player and perfecting of systems/code/features.
