The *'Digital Framework'* is a **long-term personal/hobby project** that I have made to improve my technical skills and to gain more knowledge of C++, engine systems, tools, AI, and game systems. <!--more--> 

---

## Goal

My goal is to eventually have made a small multi-platform framework and editor to make AI Systems. I would then like create a small 2D/3D game with it. As I have no big interest in low-level graphics programming, so I am using the rendering library [BGFX](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx) to make that part of the framework easier to handle. 

I aim to learn and improve by researching, reading books, and then attempting to apply that knowledge into the project â€” but not to go as far as to reinvent the wheel for certain systems.
