*'Nice Try Plane'* is a **local multiplayer COOP party game**, which was based on the game jam theme *"What Home Means To You"*. Nice Try Plane was part of the **Global Game Jam of 2019**.<!--more-->

The game is inspired by the relationship shared amongst siblings around the world. The players on the plane must score as many points that they can by knocking off the commodities and or by gathering coins. However, it isn't as easy as it sounds, because you will have to do that all while trying to keep the plane balanced.
