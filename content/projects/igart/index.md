The *'IGArt Framework'* is a **custom C++ technology made from scratch** within 16 weeks by a team of 7-9 programmers. It is heavily inspired by the *'UbiArt Framework'* and was designed to create (simple) 2D Platforming games. It works on the **PS Vita** and **Windows** platforms.

After the initial eight weeks of working on the engine, designers and artists could join the project to create a small game, and because of that, some gameplay programming was required.
