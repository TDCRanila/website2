'*PiGame*' was a **Y1 solo student project** and was developed for the **Raspberry Pi 3B** within eight weeks. The original project was about programming on embedded systems, target-based programming, and learning about **basic engine programming**. <!--more-->

## Project Details
The PiGame project was more of a tech-demo showing of a C++ custom framework and a small game on the Raspberry Pi. 

The project taught me basic engine structure and it improved my C++ skills. Some of the code and decisions were definitely questionable, but making mistakes is fine, as long that you learn from them.

The game itself is fairly minimal as it was made quickly, but shows functional gameplay on the system. The game itself was inspired by the old *DOOM* and *Quake* games.
